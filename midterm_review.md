# COMP 271 MIDTERM REVIEW

In my opinion, if this class were a job I would be doing a pretty good job. I would not be the best worker but I would still get the job done. I have been engaged in class, answered questions, and questions which I did not know the answer to I have researched them outside of class time. I have been reading the book the professor reccomended to the class, Effective Java - Third Edition, as well as watching youtube videos about Java. I spend quite a bit of time on the homework and barely manage to turn it in on time due to a lot of struggling. I have missed 2 classes due to having to go to Minnesota for jury duty and having to take my girlfriend to the doctor, but I have never just decided to skip the class. Something I could do better is speaking up in class. There are many times where I do know the answer but I constantly question myself on whether I am right or not. I could also email the professor with more questions instead of trying to solve them on my own. After writing this, I realize that there is a lot more that I can do to procure a better future. I will take the initative more and reach out more. If I had to give myself a grade for how well I've done so far in this class, I would give myself a B, it's not quite A worthy but hopefully I will get there.
